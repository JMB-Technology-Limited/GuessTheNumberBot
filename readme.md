Guess The Number Bot
====================

Run 

    python engine.py

This will run the bot in the file bot.py and play the game

How do we know this bot is working?

Run

    python testBot.py

See results!

How good is this bot? Run

    python performance.py

Is this what we expect? What if we change the max to 200?

Can you write a better bot? What is the performance of your bot? Can you write some tests for it?

There is a answer in answer.py that you can copy over bot.py but no peeking an advance!
